Calibration and deembedding for impedance measurments

Three algorithms in Python are used to enable the impedance measurements in wire samples on a vector network analyzer (VNA). Follow the detailed manual-report saved in the pdf file (Multi-stage calibration for impedance measurements).

You will need the following Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy, scipy.interpolate
